RB41 - README
Overview
RB41 is a decentralized cryptocurrency project emphasizing peer-to-peer (P2P) communication for mining and inter-node interaction. This README provides an overview of the P2P networking implementation within the RB41 project.

P2P Connection Handling
Node Initialization
RB41 network utilizes a P2P connection model where each node acts as both a client and a server. Key components of the P2P setup include:

connected_clients: A dictionary to track connected clients in the network.
server: Represents the server node managing P2P connections.
first_client_addr: Stores the address information of the first connecting client.
data_from_server: Container for data received from the Flask server.
P2P Connection Function
The handle_p2p_connection function is crucial for managing P2P connections. It handles incoming client connections and manages communication between clients and the server. The function follows these steps:

Initialization:

When a new P2P connection is established, the function prints information about the connection.
Server Setup:

If it's the first client to connect, the server is initialized, and the connection with the Flask server is established.
Data Exchange:

Data received from the Flask server is relayed to connected clients.
Data received from clients is relayed to the Flask server.
Error Handling:

The function includes error handling to manage unexpected issues during P2P communication.
Connection Closure:

Upon completion of the communication or if an error occurs, the connection is closed, and relevant entries are removed.
Usage
Node Initialization:

Before running the P2P connection, ensure that the necessary variables (connected_clients, server, first_client_addr, data_from_server) are properly set.
P2P Connection Handling:

Call the handle_p2p_connection function, passing the client socket and client address as parameters.
Server-Client Interaction:

Clients communicate with each other and the Flask server through the P2P connection.
Error Management:

The function includes mechanisms to handle errors gracefully.
Connection Closure:

Connections are closed appropriately after communication is complete or when errors occur.
Notes
The RB41 P2P network is designed to facilitate decentralized communication among nodes.
Ensure that the necessary network configurations are in place for successful P2P communication.
