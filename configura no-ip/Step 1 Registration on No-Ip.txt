Step 1: Registration on No-IP
Go to the No-IP website at https://www.noip.com/.
Create an account or log in if you already have one.
After logging in, go to the "Dynamic DNS" section and click "Add a Host".
Choose a hostname (what will be used to access your computer remotely) and select the desired domain (e.g. no-ip.org).
Select your hostname renewal time (interval at which your IP will be automatically updated).
Click "Add Host" to save the settings.
Step 2: Download and Install No-IP Software
Download the No-IP DUC (Dynamic Update Client) client from https://www.noip.com/download.
Install the software by following the on-screen instructions.
During installation, log in with your No-IP account.
Choose the hosts you want to associate with your dynamic IP.
Step 3: Router Configuration (Port Forwarding)
To access your computer remotely, you need to configure port forwarding on your router. The exact details vary by router model, but generally involve:

Access your router's settings through a browser by entering the router's IP address (see your router's manual for information on the default IP address).
Locate the port forwarding or "Port Forwarding" section.
Add a rule to forward connections on the desired port (for example, port 80 for HTTP access) to your computer's local IP address.
Step 4: Verification
Open the No-IP DUC software on your computer.
DUC will automatically detect your public IP and update the host in No-IP with that IP.
Access your computer remotely using the hostname you configured in No-IP.
